# LLM-Driven-AI-Chatbot-For-intelligent-Data-Retrieval-and-Learning-Assistance
This project aims to develop a web-based AI chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically using Gemini with LangChain and a vector store to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. It improves upon traditional bots by offering personalized, real-time academic assistance across domains through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system fetches relevant information from user-uploaded PDF course materials, providing accurate, human-like answers. The chatbot adapts to diverse academic queries and maintains consistency in conversation. It is integrated with a user-friendly Streamlit frontend for real-time access and is intended to support students and instructors in improving digital learning outcomes.
